# Tachometer

This repository defines an example of a Docker extension. The files in this repository have been automatically generated as a result of running `docker extension init`.

This extension is composed of:

- A [frontend](./ui) app in React that makes a request to the `/hello` endpoint and displays the payload in Docker Desktop.

> You can build your Docker Extension using your fav tech stack:
>
> - Frontend: React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, etc.
>   Basically, any frontend framework you can bundle in an `index.html` file with CSS, and JS assets.

## Local development

You can use `docker` to build, install and push your extension. Also, we provide an opinionated [Makefile](Makefile) that could be convenient for you. There isn't a strong preference of using one over the other, so just use the one you're most comfortable with.

To build the extension, use `make build-extension` **or**:

```shell
  docker buildx build -t julianb90/tachometer:latest . --load
```

To install the extension, use `make install-extension` **or**:

```shell
  docker extension install julianb90/tachometer:latest
```

> If you want to automate this command, use the `-f` or `--force` flag to accept the warning message.

To preview the extension in Docker Desktop, open Docker Dashboard once the installation is complete. The left-hand menu displays a new tab with the name of your extension. You can also use `docker extension ls` to see that the extension has been installed successfully.

### Frontend development

During the development of the frontend part, it's helpful to use hot reloading to test your changes without rebuilding your entire extension. To do this, you can configure Docker Desktop to load your UI from a development server.
Assuming your app runs on the default port, start your UI app and then run:

```shell
  cd ui
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

This starts a development server that listens on port `3000`.

You can now tell Docker Desktop to use this as the frontend source. In another terminal run:

```shell
  docker extension dev ui-source julianb90/tachometer:latest http://localhost:3000
```

In order to open the Chrome Dev Tools for your extension when you click on the extension tab, run:

```shell
  docker extension dev debug julianb90/tachometer:latest
```

Each subsequent click on the extension tab will also open Chrome Dev Tools. To stop this behaviour, run:

```shell
  docker extension dev reset julianb90/tachometer:latest
```

### Clean up

To remove the extension:

```shell
docker extension rm julianb90/tachometer:latest
```
